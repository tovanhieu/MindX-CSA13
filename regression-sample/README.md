# Lettuce Growth Days Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing the growth days of lettuce under varying conditions. The main goal is to understand the impact of different environmental factors such as temperature, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), and others on the growth duration of lettuce plants. The analysis includes data visualization, multivariable regression, and prediction modeling.

## Introduction

Lettuce is a popular leafy vegetable that requires optimal conditions for efficient growth. Understanding how environmental factors affect growth duration can help optimize farming practices and increase yield. This project uses a dataset that contains measurements of various environmental factors and the corresponding number of days taken for lettuce to reach maturity.

## Installation

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ngfuong/regression-sample.git
    cd regression-sample
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```
    python -m venv .venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage


To run the web report:

1. Ensure the dataset is placed in the correct directory.
2. Execute the script:
    ```
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
